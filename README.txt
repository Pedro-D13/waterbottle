#  WaterBottle Cli

WaterBottle CLI, is a tool used for my own understanding and practice towards understanding Java Programming!

# Installation


# Create a ``` WaterBottle ``` Object and then run the methods found on the object.

```
        WaterBottle myBottle = new WaterBottle();
        myBottle.openBottle();
        myBottle.drinkWater();
        myBottle.fillWaterBottle();
        myBottle.closeBottle();
```
